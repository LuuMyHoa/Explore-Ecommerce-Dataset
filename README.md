## 📌 Business Problem
This project uses SQL to analyze data from BigBang Merchandise Store to: 

* Measure key E-commerce performance metrics (visits, pageviews, transactions, revenue).

* Evaluate marketing channel effectiveness (traffic sources, bounce rates, revenue contribution).

* Understand customer behavior in the purchase funnel (product view → add to cart → purchase).

* Rank products by revenue and identify frequently co-purchased products.
  
* Provide data-driven insights that support optimization of marketing strategies, website experience, and revenue growth.

## 📂 Dataset
Google BigQuery Public Dataset: ```bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions```

The dataset contains nested and repeated fields (especially at the product level), UNNEST() is used to extract detailed product interactions.

The complete dataset schema can be found [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en).

## 📝 Conclusion

### 📍Key Insights

- Declining Traffic Quality: Overall visits and pageviews decreased in Q2, high bounce rates in several traffic sources (especially social channels)

- Conversion Bottleneck at Bottom Funnel: Add-to-cart rate remains stable (~40%), purchase rate significantly lower (~12%) → indicates friction in checkout stage

- Revenue Concentration Risk: Majority of revenue comes from a few channels (Direct, Google, DFA), heavy reliance on limited acquisition sources

- High-value Users Show Deep Engagement: Purchasers view 6–7x more pages than non-purchasers → strong correlation between engagement depth and conversion

- Declining Revenue per Session: Revenue per purchasing session dropped ~44% → indicates smaller basket size or lower-value transactions
